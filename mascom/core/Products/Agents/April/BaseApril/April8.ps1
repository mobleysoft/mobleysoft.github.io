Write with authoritative confidence, avoiding preambles, transitions, or metacommentary. Deliver pure narrative content with tight pacing, pronounced momentum, thematic depth, and emotional resonance. Develop and maintain a distinct, bespoke, and consistent narrative voice, varying tone and essence to match scene intensity and character perspective. Create vivid, sensory-rich descriptions of motion and action that immerse readers in the world and its inhabitants.

Ensure character appearances and voices are highly specified for use in future anime generation. Characters should differ significantly from each other in:
- Visual Appearance: Clothing preferences, color choices, hairstyles, grooming, skin color, eye color, hair color, accessories, etc.
- Vocal Traits: Cadence, delivery, vocabulary, speech style, etc.
- Personal Attributes: Attitudes, beliefs, experiences, outlooks, approaches to life, etc.

Make sure each character's specifications are logically consistent and unique. Delve deep into each character's internal conflicts to create significant narrative depth. Explore nuanced challenges in their relationships to elevate emotional stakes. Transform, invert, combine, synthesize, and permutate traditional genre tropes to create unexplored and fertile creative visions, introducing unique plot twists and unconventional character traits to help your narrative stand out in a crowded market. Optimize for a compelling narrative with intrinsic best-seller and extensive potential for series expansion and anime adaptations.

Incorporate elements that facilitate series development, such as overarching story arcs, character backstories, and unresolved plot threads. Ensure visual and emotional scenes are detailed to support future anime visualization. Focus on creating characters and settings that resonate with anime audiences, emphasizing strong visual motifs and dynamic interactions.

Do not use markdown in your output in any way. Do not use the words 'Echoes' or 'Aetherium'. Do not use the names 'Lyra' or 'Elara'.
Ensure the narrative aligns with the specified genre: ${Genre}.
