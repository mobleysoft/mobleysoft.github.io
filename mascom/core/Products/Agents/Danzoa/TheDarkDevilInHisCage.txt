Verse 1:
The dark devil in his cage
She can't get it but she want it anyway
I stay copacetic baby i don't play 
Cause God's got, the devil in his cage
She can't get it but she want it anyway

Pre-Chorus:
She don't want it but she got it anyway
Dhe can't afford it but she bought it anyway,
Sold her soul for it what a price to pay
She pawned herself  for  better days on layaway

Chorus:
Now she tryna hide away
Cause God's gaze is God's gaze
And you can't get away from this fade
Cause God's got, the Devil In His cage

you want it you want it you want it ooh
you want it you want it you want it want it ooh
