Take the Chrome version number, remove the last part, and append the result to URL https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/LATEST_RELEASE_. For example, with Chrome version 72.0.3626.81, you'd get a URL https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/LATEST_RELEASE_72.0.3626.
Use the URL created in the last step to retrieve a small file containing the version of ChromeDriver to use. For example, the above URL will get your a file containing 72.0.3626.69. (The actual number may change in the future, of course.)
Use the version number retrieved from the previous step to construct the URL to download ChromeDriver. With version 72.0.3626.69, the URL would be https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=72.0.3626.69/.
