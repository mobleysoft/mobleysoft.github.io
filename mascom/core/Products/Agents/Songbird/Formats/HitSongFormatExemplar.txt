[Theme]
She didn't know that day she woke 
That she would go to work to find a wretch and say what games ya play  
I'm not so naive today, nonsense,
So don't you say, hey hey hey

[Intro]
Once upon I'd rue the day we met and no regrets  
I've got none of them left there's only one thing left  
And that's to say, hey hey hey  
She didn't know that day she woke  
That she would go to work to find a wretch and say what games ya play  
Yet in my defense, all I say is, hey hey hey  

[Hook}
You know that I love you baby Don't let me inside  
You're much too good for me  I'm lost, the other side  
Has got the best of me  

[PreChorus]
I really don't have much to say For that it'd be your love  
And that's too much for me I don't want so much  
Just dance for me!

[Chorus]
Hey there little darlin' Listen to me one last time  
Here is my life I wrote a song Thats it, now rhyme.  
Remember me, for this line  

[Bridge]
She didn't know that day she woke That she would go to work to find a wretch and say what games ya play  
I'm not so naive today, nonsense,
So don't you saaay, hey hey hey

[Hook]
You know that I love you baby Don't let me inside  
You're much too good for me I'm lost, the other side  
Has got the best of me  

{PreChorus]
I won't ask you to set me free For that it'd be your love  
And that's too much for me I don't want so much!
Just dance for me!

[Chorus]
Hey there little darlin' Listen to me one last time  
Here is my life I wrote a song Thats it, now rhyme.  
Remember me for this line! 

[Bridge]
She didn't know that day she woke That she would go to work to find a wretch and say what games ya play  
I'm not so naive today, nonsense,
So don't you saaay, hey hey hey

[Feature]
Once upon I'd rue the day we met and no regrets  
I've got none of them left there's only one thing left  
She didn't know that day she woke  
That she would go to work to find a wretch and say what games ya play  
I really don't have much to say For that it'd be your love  
And that's too much for me I don't want so much! 
Just dance for meee!

[Outro]
She didn't know that day she woke  
That she would go to work to find a wretch and say what games ya play  
I'm not so naive today, nonsense
So don't you say, hey hey hey hey hey HEY! HEY!
