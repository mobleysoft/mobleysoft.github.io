I didn't understand, 
I was too young to see,
The good life you wanted for me,
I was a foolish man,
Still am probably,
Least now I know what you really want for me.

What you want for me, What you want for me,
What you want for me, What you want for me,
What you want for me, What you want for me,
What you want for me, what you really want for me?

Verse 2:
I'll make another plan,
I'm moving so fast,
I swear I'll find another way to grow passed
I still don't understand,
But finally know that,
You still loved me,
Even when you didn't need to do that.

Bridge 2:

Need to do that, you didn't need to do that,
Need to do that, didn't need to do that,
I swear you, didn't even need to do that!

Outro:
Finding my way back,
Love you mom,
Play that!
