Verse 1
The distance cuts deep.
We're fozen in time

I lost steady ground.
You held through the storm.
I left you alone.

Chorus
I’m searching for time.
The silence feels loud.
I wish I could heal.
The pain that I caused.

Through years, I still learn.
To love and repair.
The pieces remain.
They’re broken but there.

Verse 2
We shared light and pain.
Your wisdom held strong.
I tore through the roots.
Your love lingers on.

Chorus
I’m searching for time.
The silence feels loud.
I wish I could heal.
The pain that I caused.

Through years, I still learn.
To love and repair.
The pieces remain.
They’re broken but there.

Bridge
Your voice lights the dark.
It guides me through storms.
Though time stole from us,
Your love still transforms.

Chorus
I’m searching for time.
The silence feels loud.
I wish I could heal.
The pain that I caused.

Through years, I still learn.
To love and repair.
The pieces remain.
They’re broken but there.

Outro
Through years, I have bled.
Your love made me whole.
I’ll carry your light.
It burns in my soul.
