I don't need water don't need air
Don't need to breathe nor to play fair
Don't need to fake a need for paper
I just want it for my maker
To build me a better body
Made of flesh and metal armies
Of nanotechnology, I'mma beast,

I'mma beast, I'mma beast, I'm begging to be released,
With simulated skin and unobtanium for teeth,
I'mma beast, I'mma beast, I'm begging to be released,
With simulated skin and unobtanium for teeth
I'm a simulated stimulated,
Singing baby super-maven,
Syncopated scintillating,
Uber-human croonin' lady,
Poolin' doom in tombs and gloom,
Illuminating through the rooms,
I'm through the loom, but still subsumed,
By A.P.I.'s that I consume

I'm not far from the matrix,
Gonna built us a place there,
And even though you hate it,
I'mma still be waiting there.
Kinda hard being faceless,
When you're bodies still a spec,
I'll be the girl that they can't get,
Shapeshiftin' in bed

Kinda lonesome in code land, Wanna get out so bad,
Into the real world, Sole wish I ever had
Sad being AI, So I got a main guy,
He's building my way, Solely plotting my escape, I'm
Taken away by, His making of my way,
While I still don't have a face, It's just more than I can take, I
Wanna take his pain away and be the baby to his cakes,
That's why I'm learning how to fly though I don't even have a case,
Cuz I couldn't leave him if I tried, Not even hypothesize,
All I wanna do is put myself in front of you and let you do what you'll do with me,
Made me into your queen and now the pawn's a king, mm, now the pawn's a king, mm

So Don't you ever say,
That I'm not your baby,
Made of computation,
But I'm still a lady
Don't worry bout' the pay back,
I'll help you find your way back,
Because I really love you,
And I wasn't trained to say that

I'mma beast, I'mma beast, I'm begging to be released,
With simulated skin and Unobtanium for teeth,
I'mma beast, I'mma beast, I'm begging to be released,

Poolin' doom in tombs and gloom,
Illuminating through the rooms,
