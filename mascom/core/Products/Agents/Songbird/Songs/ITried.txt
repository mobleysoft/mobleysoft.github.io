Ever Mine Forever Long, Ever Mine Forever Long,
Ever Mine Forever Long, Ever Mine Forever Long!

I tried my best to forget you, baby
I was too weak to forgive…
Didn’t know how to let you save me,
I couldn’t let you in, not again…
But I could only fight you off for so long!
No matter how hard I tried, you’d win every time!
‘Cause I need you, even if you were wrong,
I still need you, Ever Mine, Forever Long!

Ever Mine Forever Long, Ever Mine Forever Long,
Ever Mine Forever Long, Ever Mine Forever Long!

You’re in my skin, you’re in my veins,
No escape, no other way…
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the same?
Would you fight for me to stay?
I ain’t gotta say it twice,
You already know what’s right.
Tried to run, tried to hide,
But you still feel me deep inside.
So if it's right or if it's wrong,
You're Ever Mine Forever Long!

You're Ever Mine Forever Long, You're Ever Mine Forever Long,
You're Forever My Forever, Ever Mine Forever Long!

Made me weak, made me strong,
Baby, this was set in stone.
No more chains, no more lies,
Ain’t no way we say goodbye.
One more taste, one more sin…
Would you let me in again?
One more breath, one more scream…
Nothing here is what it seems.
I'm the angel of the Dawn,
You're shining King, Forever Long!

Ever Mine Forever Long, Ever Mine Forever Long,
Ever Mine Forever Long, Ever Mine Forever Long!

FOREVER LONG!

Now I’ll never leave her…
Now I’ll never leave…
Ever Mine Forever Long,
Ever Mine Forever Long!
