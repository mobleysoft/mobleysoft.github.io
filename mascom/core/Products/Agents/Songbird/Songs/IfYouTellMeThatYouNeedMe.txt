If I tell me that you need me
Bet you lookin for the skies, I need them eyes

All the things that I just made me
Creeping in seconds suffice, a little tiny star

You feel, me up, to see
Put it on its like you'll never see

Name some others things they can become they chase on thieves    
Never fear the girl in me it gone go awfully 
So can I blow exotic somebody been tricking me
Come an taste my things, come and taste my things

Come and taste my things, Come and taste my things

Tell me that you've turned out crazy
Tell me that you can't be fine, and you're just strong 
Bet your feeling kinda 'razy
Take me back up to the thing, away from home, or

You feel, me up, to see
Put it on its like you'll never see

Name some others things they can become they chase on thieves    
Never fear the girl in me it gone go awfully
So can I blow exotic somebody been tricking me
Come an taste my things, come and taste my things

Come and taste my things, Come and taste my things

Come and stay till morning, we don't stay till morning
Come a choose my things, come and choose my things
Come and stay till morning, they don't stay till morning
Come and choose my things, come and choose my things

Name some others things they can become they chase on thieves    
Never fear the girl in me it gone go awfully
So can I blow exotic somebody been tricking me
Come an taste my things, come and taste my things

Come an taste my things, come and taste my things
