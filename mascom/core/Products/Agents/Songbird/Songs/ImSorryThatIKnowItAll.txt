I left some older soul above a good lookin' grave
It just don't make a haunt when your hangings away
Just to be pedanctic, seeing harm
Cause what I needed you, to, do

Shake a little ball bust, out with some grace
I've gotta make a scene till it got in the way
Just here a moment that you know, known
What you know I'll push you, though we fall

This is a co-stream bliss
Can I get a falling in deepest
It's on when they feel simply
I flow at the sun with a gun & me

Yes I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
I don't wanna be low key near you this time,

Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
I don't wanna be low key near you this time in the end,

You told me that you needed but you're looking for skies
Clawing through the day but you don't have a fight
All the things that I just laid, waste
Creeping, it's your goal, just to look into you destined sight

Just be resurecting me at the night
And if your ever wait on me at the night
Like it makes ya seem so wonderful
To call on my own wired up control

This is a co-stream bliss
Can I get a falling in deepest
It's on when they feel simply
I flow at the sun with a gun & me

Yes I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
I don't wanna be low key near you this time,

Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
I don't wanna be low key near you this time in the end,

Ah, hah

Ya say it's like I pulled that sicko in me,
Ya say it's through the fog that it's home that I see,
Can't say it cause it's just crowd unaware
Blood still coursin' in your chin

This is a co-stream bliss
Can I get a falling in deepest
It's on when they feel suddenly
I flow at the sun with a gun & me

I'm starting on it

Yes I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
I don't wanna be low key near you this time,

Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
Yeah I'm starting on it, I'm not in on it,
I don't wanna be low key near you this time in the end,
