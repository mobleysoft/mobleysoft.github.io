She didn't know that day she woke  
That she would go to work to find a wretch and say what games ya play  
I'm not so naive today, nonsense
So don't you say, hey hey hey.

Once upon I'd rue the day we met and no regrets  
I've got none of them left there's only one thing left  
And that's to say, hey hey hey  

She didn't know that day she woke  
That she would go to work to find a wretch and say what games ya play  
Yet in my defense, all I say is, hey hey hey  

I really don't have much to say  
For that it'd be your love  
And that's too much for me  
I don't want so much  
Just dance for me, Aerindy  

Hey there little darlin'  
Listen to me one last time  
Here is my life I wrote a song  
That's it, now rhyme.  
Remember me, for this line  

If only she had known that day  
That she would meet a songwriting guitar fool  
She might not have gone  
But come on home  
Persa Phone  

You know that I love you baby  
Don't let me inside  
You're much too good for me  
I'm lost, the other side  
Has got the best of me  

I won't ask you to set me free  
For that it'd be your love  
And that's too much for me  
I don't want so much  
Just dance for me, Aerindy!

She didn't know that day she woke  
That she would go to work to find a wretch and say what games ya play  
I'm not so naive today, nonsense
So don't you say, hey hey hey
