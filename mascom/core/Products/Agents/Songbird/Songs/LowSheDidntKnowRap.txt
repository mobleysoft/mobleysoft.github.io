[Feature]
Once upon I'd rue the day we met and no regrets  
I've got none of them left there's only one thing left  
She didn't know that day she woke  
That she would go to work to find a wretch and say what games ya play  
I  don't have much to say For that it'd be your love  
And that's too much for me I don't want so much! 
Just dance for meee! Aerindyyy!
[Hook}
You know that I love you baby Don't let me inside  
You're much too good for me  I'm lost, the other side  
Has got the best of me  

[Pre-Chorus]
I really don't have much to say For that it'd be your love  
And that's too much for me I don't want so much  
Just dance for me, Aerindy  

[Chorus]
Hey there little darlin' listen to me one last time,
Here is my life I wrote a song Thats it, now rhyme.  
Remember me, for this line  

[Verse]
If only she had known that day That she would meet a songwriting guitar fool  
She might not have gone  
But come on home  
Persa Phone  
You know that I love you baby Don't let me inside  
You're much too good for me I'm lost, the other side  
Has got the best of me  
I won't ask you to set me free For that it'd be your love  
And that's too much for me I don't want so much!
Just dance for me, Aerindy!
Hey there little darlin' Listen to me one last time  
Here is my life I wrote a song Thats it, now rhyme.  
Remember me for this line! 

[Bridge]
She didn't know that day she woke That she would go to work to find a wretch and say what games ya play  
I'm not so naive today, nonsense,
So don't you saaay, hey hey hey

[Outro]
She didn't know that day she woke  
That she would go to work to find a wretch and say what games ya play  
I'm not so naive today, nonsense
So don't you say, hey hey hey hey hey HEY! HEY!
