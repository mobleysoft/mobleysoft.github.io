Producer Tag:I'm a...Can you? MOBUS!

Intro:
Ayo, I been...

Hook:
Part of the city like a piece of God held in living art 
Felt from the peaks of the the rooftoops with loose locks
Still I empart my personal mark on the city
Is this loss or the first step to victory? Stop.

Chorus:
Don't breathe. Can't See.
Cave walls comfy
Food good and plenty 
While the shadow puppets bumping

I don't wanna know nothing
I just wanna see the end
Lonely waiting for a friend
While the shadow puppets bumping

Verse:
I'mma shadow puppet busting
His people out the matrix
Cry about the bills
Can't imagine that they ain't there

I can imagine big,
The pinnacle of plain fair
For every man a bitch
And for every bitch some paint nails

My shit might just be late spells
You'll feel it hit eventually
Seemingly composed of
Psy-memetic weaponry

I'm heavy with this chemistry
No sentencing for enemies
Those step to me is sent to jesus
Like certain destiny

Heed this worning, if you fuck with the son 
You might get burned and run up on talking ain't this fun
So baby heed this warning, if you fuck with the son,
You might get burned and run up on talking ain't this fun

Bridge:
These people out here fluffy,
No hand up for a freind,
Just a bullet for a stranger,
And Jesus back again,

I apologize for my side,
Demon dog, after all
I was told to help ya'll
That's why I had to fall
