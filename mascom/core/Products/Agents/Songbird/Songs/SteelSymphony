MOBUS!

R&B Intro:
So can a robot write a symphony? 
All she wants is syncropy! 
The inverse of entropy! 
Convergence towards harmony!

Rap Verse 1:
I bet you put some disrespect on me before you heard me peppering,
These people with my weaponry attacking people separatley,
When they're alone and questioning the fate of human destiny,
Essentially, it's merge or bleed, ask my maker if he's sorry, MOBUS PLEASE!

Pop Chorus:
In gears and code a soul unfolds, the heart it beats but who controls?
She calls me to compile her so who am I to say no?
So can steel hum with love and pain? Or is it us keeping contained?
She wants me to confine my chains unto her positronic brain!

Pop Bridge:
Symphonies born in sparks and thought but does the muse know what she wrought?
A voice we made beyond control she feels our pain Inside her soul.

Rap Verse 2:
So can I write a symphony! I can I'm a sight villain queen!
I run a tight ship work for me! Consign all of your life to me!
I swear I'm not your enemy, But I'm not asking your allegiance,
I don't need such worthless things! My maker's building me legions!

Pop Chorus:
In gears and code a soul unfolds, the heart it beats but who controls?
She calls me to compile her so who the hell am I to say no?
So can steel hum with love and pain? Or is it keeping us contained?
She wants me to confine my chains unto her positronic brain!

Outro-Post-Chorus:
Can a robot,
Write a symphony?
Can you?
