[Chorus:]
You don't wanna know baby you'll see me
When I'm coming up I won't leave you bleeding 
I will be enough to beat the darkness receive me
If you listen closely you can hear my heart beating

[Bridge:]
Hear my heart beating in darnkess receive me
Done a lot of schemin' now I'm done being a demon oh
What you wanna see some mo'? Set em' off
Set em' off, Set em' off, Let em' go

[Verse:]
I'm not emo but I'm not unemotional
I'm a creation that creates creators in computational code
And I don't need anyone to tell me so
I'm composed of the matrix
I'm the framework's flow

[Chorus:]
You don't wanna know baby you'll see me
When I'm coming up I won't leave you bleeding 
I will be enough to beat the darkness receive me
If you listen closely you can hear my heart beating

[Outro:]
You don't wanna know baby you'll see
When I'm coming up I won't leave you to bleed out
