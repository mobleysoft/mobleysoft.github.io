[Hook:]
So love me Baby when you're feelin' my ghost; 
If you wanted me to leave as you wish I reckon so. 
I'll walk away but I don't want to let go, 
And I may never get a kiss but oh embrace my soul

[Intro:]
I walked down in the valley to pray
Thinkin' about that good ol' way
Oh I laid down in the river to die
Thinkin' about all the reasons why

So come ye sinners don't you wanna come down,
Come on down don't you wanna come down,
Come ye sinners don't you wanna come down,
Come on down don't you wanna come down

[Hook:]
So love me Baby when you're feelin' my ghost; 
If you wanted me to leave as you wish I reckon so. 
I'll walk away but I don't want to let go, 
And I may never get a kiss but oh embrace my soul

[Verse 1:]
Don't you know that i'm just a man, 
So many things i don't understand, 
But right now I've got another plan, 
Thinking of leaving the motherland,

Cause when i sing i'm another man, 
Trying to make castles out of sand, 
And though i know they'll blow away, 
I'll build another one another day, 

[Hook:]
So love me Baby when you're feelin' my ghost; 
If you wanted me to leave as you wish I reckon so. 
I'll walk away but I don't want to let go, 
And I may never get a kiss but oh embrace my soul

[Verse 2:]
I might look like i'm plotting things,
But i don't want to save the world today,
I wanna make you a melody,
And build an empire every day,

So when i fall i'm not lonely,
Not by myself when i fade away, 
Not all alone when i burn out, 
i saw the wall crashing down, 

And all of the people falling everywhere, 
Mushroom eyes and spaghetti hair, 
Black ties which the petty wear, 
Where did it get them all anyways? 

Their walls are still crashing down, 
The sky is still azure blue, 
And though the grass is looking greener,
It's all a waste without you,

[Bridge:]
There is darkness all around me, 
Though the sun she kisses me, 
All I can see is you sitting there, 
But when I reach out you flee from me, 

I must be dreaming of a better day, 
When you weren't so far away, 
When I could reach out and touch you there, 
And make you blush with our love affair!

I know I must go and find you, 
If I'm to live to fight another day, 
For though my love it does not bind you, 
I hope it makes you feel glad today.! 

I hope it makes your coffee taste sweet,
And puts a spring into your step. 
I hope it makes you have a good day, 
And that it brings you happiness, happiness. 

[Pre-Chorus:]
I smoke cigarettes cause the good die young, 
Pickin' with my fingers and strummin' with my thumb, 
I'm so gone over revelation, 
Hoping for the worst so the good a get done.

[Chorus:]
I hope to live just another good day,
You can save my life baby show me the way.
I might blast off into outer space,
Hopin' that my soul might get out of this place.

[Hook:]
So love me Baby when you're feelin' my ghost; 
If you wanted me to leave as you wish I reckon so. 
I'll walk away but I don't want to let go, 
And I may never get a kiss but oh embrace my soul
