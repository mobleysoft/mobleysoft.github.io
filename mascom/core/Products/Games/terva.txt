Side Scroller Game World Map: Generate a 2D side-scrolling world map in pixel art style for a side-scrolling platformer game. The map must strictly follow a side-scrolliing perspective, ensuring all elements are designed for side-scrolling gameplay in a cohesive and playable side-scrolling environment. The side-scroller map should include:

1. **Side-Scrolling Biomes with Smooth Transitions on the surface horizontal plane**:
   - Forest: Open grassy areas with trees, foliage, and light hazards, all designed for side-scrolling gameplay in a side-scroller style.
   - Caves: Enclosed, dark areas with stalactites, stalagmites, and occasional water pools, all visible and traversable from a side-scroller perspective.
   - Lava Zones: Flowing lava rivers, jagged platforms, and high hazards, all designed for side-scrolling gameplay in a side-scroller environment.

2. **Castlevania-Inspired Side-Scroller Castles**:
   - Towers: Tall, vertical structures with climbable platforms and narrow walkways, all visible in a side-scroller perspective for side-scrolling gameplay.
   - Rooms: Multi-level interiors with stairs, windows, and chandeliers, all designed for side-scrolling interaction in a side-scroller platformer.
   - Corridors: Long horizontal pathways with doors, breakable walls, and hidden areas, all designed for seamless side-scrolling exploration in a side-scroller map.

3. **Side-Scroller Gameplay Zones**:
   - Starting Area: A safe zone with clear, open pathways leading into the side-scroller biomes, all visible from a side-scroller perspective.
   - Treasures (yellow): Strategically placed treasures positioned near hazards (red) to encourage side-scroller exploration and risk-reward gameplay in a side-scroller map.
   - Boss Rooms (purple): Large, enclosed areas located at key destinations, all designed for dramatic encounters in side-scrolling gameplay in a side-scroller perspective.

4. **Side-Scrolling Platforming Elements**:
   - Platforms at varying heights for vertical exploration in a side-scroller environment.
   - Drop zones, climbable walls, and bridges, all designed for smooth side-scrolling interaction in a side-scroller platformer.

5. **Side-Scroller Color-Coded Terrain**:
   - Black (#000000): Solid walls for a side-scroller platformer.
   - White (#FFFFFF): Traversable pathways for side-scrolling gameplay in a side-scroller environment.
   - Red (#FF0000): Hazards (spikes, lava, or enemies) designed for side-scrolling challenges.
   - Yellow (#FFFF00): Treasures for side-scrolling exploration in a side-scroller map.
   - Blue (#0000FF): Water (pools or rivers) integrated into side-scrolling gameplay.
   - Purple (#800080): Boss rooms for major side-scrolling encounters.

6. **Side-Scrolling Vertical and Horizontal Balance**:
   - Ensure vertical exploration with towers and caves, all designed for seamless side-scrolling interaction in a side-scroller platformer.
   - Maintain horizontal flow with interconnected pathways, all visible from a side-scroller perspective.

7. **Side-Scrolling Art Style**:
   - Crisp pixel art designed for side-scroller gameplay, with clear visual differentiation between side-scrolling foreground elements (interactable) and background layers (decorative), all in a side-scroller perspective.

8. **Side-Scrolling Layout**:
   - Logical pathways connecting biomes and castles, avoiding floating or disconnected structures unless intentional (e.g., floating platforms), all designed for side-scrolling exploration in a side-scroller map.

The side-scroller map must support smooth side-scrolling exploration, side-scrolling platforming challenges, and gameplay progression, all adhering to a side-scroller perspective in a side-scrolling platformer game.
