# P5ArchitectureFlow.t3cl
# TICEL Specification expressed in T3CL
# This file implements the P5 Architecture—a fractal, self-referential system
# that continuously integrates historical and biological wisdom via the LibrariesOfBooksOfLife.
# This continuous inbound flow informs both initial creation and all subsequent evolution cycles.
