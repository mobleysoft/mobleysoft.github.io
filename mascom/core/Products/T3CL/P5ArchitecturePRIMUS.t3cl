# P5_SystemOfSystems.t3cl
# TICEL Specification in T3CL (DSL on top of PowerShell 5.1)
# This file implements a P5 Architecture system‐of‐systems that continuously integrates historical and biological archives 
# (via BooksOfLife and LibrariesOfBooksOfLife) to yield the following endpoints:
#  1. Auto Book Publishing Website
#  2. Content Creator Agents Startup
#  3. Startup and AI Agent Marketplace
#  4. Edtech, Career Counselling, Mental Health Aavatar Startup
#
# The feedback loop ensures that the aggregated wisdom flows into both the initial creation and subsequent evolution cycles,
# resulting in an infinite, self-aware, self-evolving system.

T3CL_Intent -Description "Assemble a P5 Architecture system-of-systems that yields an Auto Book Publishing Website, a Content Creator Agents Startup, a Startup and AI Agent Marketplace, and an Edtech/Career Counselling/Mental Health Aavatar Startup. The system continuously integrates the LibrariesOfBooksOfLife to close the feedback loop and enable infinite evolution."
