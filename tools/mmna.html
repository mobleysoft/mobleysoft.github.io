    <h1>Mobley Method Narrative Architecture (MMNA)</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction to MMNA</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Mobley Method Narrative Architecture (MMNA)</strong> is a structured framework designed to map the development of characters and their narratives across multiple time periods and parallel worlds. This matrix facilitates a clear visualization of each character's evolution, ensuring systematic progress and cohesive storytelling. MMNA is particularly useful for complex narratives involving dual worlds, character transformations, and intertwined destinies.

        <h2>Structure of MMNA Matrix</h2>
        <p>
            The MMNA Matrix maps each character's development through six key narrative periods across both the Real World and the fantasy realm (e.g., Aether). The matrix is organized with characters as rows and narrative periods as columns, detailing their states and transformations at each stage.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Time Periods Defined</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Happy Past:</strong> A period of harmony, strong relationships, and creative fulfillment before the central conflict begins.</li>
            <li><strong>Downfall:</strong> The onset of conflict, loss, and the beginning of the protagonists' struggles.</li>
            <li><strong>Tragic Present:</strong> The current state of despair, strained relationships, and significant challenges.</li>
            <li><strong>Adventure:</strong> The phase where the protagonist embarks on a journey or quest, facing trials and uncovering secrets.</li>
            <li><strong>Reckoning:</strong> The climax where major confrontations occur, leading to resolutions or deeper conflicts.</li>
            <li><strong>Revival:</strong> The resolution and restoration of harmony, growth, and the culmination of the protagonists' journeys.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Key Themes and Symbolism</h2>
        
        <h3>Emordnilap Naming Strategy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Emordnilap names enhance the symbolic connections between characters in the Real World and their counterparts in Aether, emphasizing duality and interconnectedness.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Serafin (Sera) Healy ↔ Nifares (Nifa):</strong> "Serafin" reversed is "Nifares," highlighting their intertwined destinies and the evolution from judgment to support. Note that Sera Healy adopts the last name Mace upon marrying Max in the Revival period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lyra Mace ↔ Queen Aryl (Ariel) Mace:</strong> "Lyra" reversed is "Aryl," maintaining phonetic similarity while differentiating their roles in each world.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quinton Mace ↔ Quill:</strong> While not a direct emordnilap, "Quinton" shares phonetic elements with "Quill," symbolizing wisdom and guidance across both worlds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ranger Mace ↔ Regent Regnar:</strong> "Ranger" shares letters with "Regnar," indicating a corrupted transformation driven by grief.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ms. Finch ↔ Mistress Nihf:</strong> "Finch" reversed is "Nihf," transforming from a supportive teacher to a ruthless antagonist, emphasizing the theme of hidden darkness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Interconnected Timelines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dual Worlds Impact:</strong> Actions and transformations in one world reverberate in the other, reinforcing themes of duality, redemption, and creativity.</li>
            <li><strong>Symbolism Through Art:</strong> Max’s artistic abilities act as a bridge between the worlds, with his creations in the Real World manifesting in Aether and vice versa.</li>
