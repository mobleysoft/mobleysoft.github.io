        <h2>Introduction to MMNA</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Mobley Method Narrative Architecture (MMNA)</strong> is a structured framework designed to map the development of characters and their narratives across multiple time periods and parallel worlds. This matrix facilitates a clear visualization of each character's evolution, ensuring systematic progress and cohesive storytelling. MMNA is particularly useful for complex narratives involving dual worlds, character transformations, and intertwined destinies.

        <h3>Key Themes and Symbolism</h3>
        
        <h4>Emordnilap Naming Strategy</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Emordnilap names enhance the symbolic connections between characters in the Real World and their counterparts in Aether, emphasizing duality and interconnectedness.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Serafin (Sera) Healy ↔ Nifares (Nifa) Mace:</strong> "Serafin" reversed is "Nifares," highlighting their intertwined destinies and the evolution from judgment to support.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lyra Mace ↔ Queen Aryl (Ariel) Mace:</strong> "Lyra" reversed is "Aryl," maintaining phonetic similarity while differentiating their roles in each world.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quinton Mace ↔ Quill:</strong> While not a direct emordnilap, "Quinton" shares phonetic elements with "Quill," symbolizing wisdom and guidance across both worlds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ranger Mace ↔ Regent Regnar:</strong> "Ranger" shares letters with "Regnar," indicating a corrupted transformation driven by grief.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ms. Finch ↔ Mistress Nihf:</strong> "Finch" reversed is "Nihf," transforming from a supportive teacher to a ruthless antagonist, emphasizing the theme of hidden darkness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Interconnected Timelines</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dual Worlds Impact:</strong> Actions and transformations in one world reverberate in the other, reinforcing themes of duality, redemption, and creativity.</li>
            <li><strong>Symbolism Through Art:</strong> Max’s artistic abilities act as a bridge between the worlds, with his creations in the Real World manifesting in Aether and vice versa.</li>
